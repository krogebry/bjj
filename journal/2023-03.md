Worked with Caleb and Rick on side control escape.  Cheese greater the shoulder to protect the chin.
Work left knee into chest, punch left arm threw left knee to get under hook.  Mechanical advantage with the
right leg moving the opponents ankle over their knee to the outside of their center line.  This moves the hips
and allows for the sweep.

Open mat.  Worked with Brad, hard rolls, couldn't get an angle to use size to control him.  He used his 
head a lot.  Unable to get low enough to get at his feet.  Need to work on this.

Worked with John, sorta managed to pass his guard, but not really.  It wasn't pretty; need to work on more of this.

Worked with new purple belt guy, tank fella.  Short legs made things more difficult.  Great learnings, wonderful
training partner.

Worked with Cody the DBA, his wife is working in town occasionally.  Cody taught me a neat pass, instead of moving
by body around the ouside of opps legs, I instead windshield wipper over to opposite site using my knees to pin
opps legs and move in for a potential back take.
